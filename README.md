# Simple Image Viewer + Doodler in PyGame

An application that supports the functionalities listed below:
- Viewing an Image --> User can open a Folder to view a `Batch` of images as well.
- Basic Editing Functionalities --> Crop, Scale, Zoom In/Out; (opt. Filters and Effects? --> possible?)
- Doodling on top of images (basically drawing) --> Instead of the image buffer, the user can choose to draw on a blank slate as well.
